# Password_Manager
A basic password and account manager. 
Input your username and password and it will save it to a text file, the password will be saved scrambled. 
The program can read from text file and display passwords unscrambled but they are never saved in normal form. 

Issues
Scrambler is too simple needs to be far more complex. 
Main Password setup needs to be built out.
